<h2>about</h2>
<p>We all know Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan to
    be an inseparable pair, but that wasn’t always the case.</p>
    <p>From the moment these two mismatched monsters met
        they couldn't stand each other. Monsters University
        unlocks the door to how Mike and Sulley overcame
        their differences and became the best of friends</p>
